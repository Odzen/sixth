# Sixth 🎧

**Voice AI that helps people with disabilities experience visual content through sound.**

Built for the ElevenLabs Voice AI Global Hackathon - Making visual content accessible for the 2.2 billion people worldwide with visual impairments. Took the 1st place in Mexico City.

## 💡 The Problem

Over 2.2 billion people worldwide have visual impairments. They miss out on visual content every day - from understanding what a sunset looks like to experiencing the colors of a rainbow. Traditional text descriptions and screen readers can't convey the depth, beauty, and emotion of visual experiences.

Sixth solves this with AI-powered spatial audio that transforms visual concepts into immersive sound experiences.

## ✨ What It Does

- ♿ **Accessibility First**: Designed specifically for people with visual impairments
- 🎙️ **Voice AI Agent**: Real-time conversational agent powered by ElevenLabs
- 🎵 **Spatial Audio**: Creates immersive 3D soundscapes that convey depth and emotion
- 🌅 **Visual to Audio**: Transforms visual concepts (sunsets, colors, landscapes) into rich audio narratives
- 🎨 **Interactive Demos**: Try experiencing "How does the sun feel?" or "What does a rainbow look like?"
- 🌍 **Universal Design**: Making content accessible for everyone
